## Skills
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Lessons
NPM
- software registry: contains open-source code packages
- package manager: tracks package versions and facillitates dependency installations (package installations needed for code to work) which are defined in package.json

Webpack
- Bundler: takes entry point file and creates dependency graph needed to generate a single output html file. A bundler improves browser compatibility, performance (reduces requests), and ensure dependencies are included in output.

- Configuration: webpack.config.js file w html-webpack-plugin
